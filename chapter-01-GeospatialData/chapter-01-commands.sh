########################## demo-01-InstallationOfPostgresqlAndPostGis ##########################

# We have to install 3 things for this
	# 1. Postgresql
	# 2. PgAdmin
	# 3. PostGis

# Let's install postgresql first
# For that go to following link

https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html
# Click on the download button
# Now the dmg file will download to laptop, let's start installing that
# While installing we have to set a port, password and the owner name
# (note: in the latest version it did not ask me for a password)

# I am setting up the port as follows

port : 5432
owner : loonycorn
password : loonycorn

# Now let's install pgadmin
# Cick on following link

https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin/pgadmin4/

# Go to the latest version

https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin/pgadmin4/v6.18/macos/

# Click on the following name - pgadmin*.dmg
# Download the dmg and install it

# Then let's open pgadmin and setup and password which we had setup earlier

# Click on "Add New Server"

Name: loonyserver

# Switch to the Connection tab

Hostname: localhost

# (I left the password blank and it was fine)

# Click on Save


# Set up the path for the command line (go to the terminal window and run this)


sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp


PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/ 

psql

# This should take you into the PSQL prompt

loonycorn=# 

# Type "quit" to exit


# Let's install PostGIS
# Got to our terminal and let's install
# Run following command
brew install postgis

# Then let's go to the pgadmin app again and do the extension with the postgis

# Right-click on Databases -> Create

# Create a new database "loonydb"

# Select Schemas under loonydb

# Click on the Query Tool icon on the top-left to bring up a new query window

CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

# This will be successful


########################## demo-02-UnderstandingGeographyBasics ################################

# IMPORTANT: Close the scratch pad at the right of the query pane so we have more room for the query
# Also reduce the size of the left navigation pane


CREATE TABLE geometries (name text, geom geometry);


# Click on loonydb -> Schemas -> Tables and show that two tables are created

# Click on the "geometries" table and show the columns

# Right-click on "spatial_ref_sys" -> View/Edit data -> All Rows

# Note: he SPATIAL_REF_SYS table used by PostGIS is an (Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)) OGC-compliant database table that defines the available spatial reference systems. It holds the numeric SRIDs and textual descriptions of the coordinate systems.
# http://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/geometries.html#metadata-tables

# Click on loonydb -> Schemas -> Views and show that you have the "geometry_columns" view

# Right-click on "geometry_columns" -> View/Edit data -> All Rows


# Now let's insert some geometry values

## NOTE: 4326 is the most common spatial reference for storing a referencing data across the entire world. It serves as the default for both the PostGIS spatial database and the GeoJSON standard. It is also used by default in most web mapping libraries. 
# Because of its use in GPS, 4326 is generally assumed to be the spatial reference when talking about "latitude" or "longitude".

# Now, let's add in real life points of places in UK and see the points in map

# The result is 2.584534928377638

# Now, if we search in google the distance between Wells and Truro, it is 250kms approximately
# As we have calculated it for geometry we got this value
# The units for spatial reference 4326 are degrees. So our answer is 2.584 degrees

# http://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/geography.html
# In order to calculate a meaningful distance, we must treat geographic coordinates not as approximate Cartesian coordinates but rather as true spherical coordinates.
# We must measure the distances between points as true paths over a sphere â€“ a portion of a great circle.
# PostGIS provides this functionality through the geography type.

# Let's calculate it using geography

# Which is the correct value


# Switch over to maps.google.com

maps.google.com

# Type in Wells, UK
# Directions
# Type in Truro, UK
# Show the distance is about 155 miles (roughly 200km)


# Find all places within 250kms of London (the coordinate value is for London)

# Should be
# "Worcester"
# "Winchester"
# "Wells"



# Now lets check the distance between some other place and verify the value
# We can also plot the line between these two places

SELECT ST_Distance(geography(a.sensorLocation), geography(b.sensorLocation)), 
       ST_MakeLine(a.sensorLocation, b.sensorLocation)
FROM UKPlaces a, UKPlaces b

# Now click on the st_makeline column and plot
# We can see the line between the two places

# From the query we also get the sitance between the two places in meters
